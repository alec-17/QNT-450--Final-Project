This is the code for my QNT 450 Final Project... the goal was to make a model better at predicting results of European football matches with more accuracy 
than traditional betting websites

The ml_utils.py file is from Mauro Di Pietro. I relied on his articles extenisivly when working on this project. I will provide a link to his orginal articles below:
